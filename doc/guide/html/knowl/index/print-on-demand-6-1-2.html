<div class="para">Until early 2018, Kindle Direct Publishing (<abbr class="initialism">KDP</abbr>) was a service known as CreateSpace.  Some of the information below refers to this predecessor.

<div class="para">This company is owned by Amazon.com.  They manufacture and distribute serious books, in addition to music and film.  Distribution through Amazon is nearly automatic.  There is also “Expanded Distribution”, which starts to look more like Ingram (next).  If royalties are small, using direct deposit might be the most convenient (international sales all get converted to dollars for authors in the US).

<div class="para">CreateSpace attempts to make sure you have the rights to your content.  So if they find your book freely available on the Internet, their “Content Validation Request Team” becomes suspicious and investigates.  This has caused a few authors a few headaches and delays in making their book available for sale, though all have been successful eventually.

<div class="para">If you want to offer your project electronically for no cost, you may need to do an end run.  We have a report that you can put your project on <abbr class="initialism">KDP</abbr> for a low price (e.g. $1), then offer it on Apple’s similar service for free, and then exercise a price match guarantee back on <abbr class="initialism">KDP</abbr>.  Reports on this technique encouraged.
