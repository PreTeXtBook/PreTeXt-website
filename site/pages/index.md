PreTeXt is an authoring and publishing system for authors of textbooks, research articles, and monographs, especially in STEM disciplines.

The best of DocBook, LaTeX, and HTML.

Outputs: print, PDF, web, EPUB, Jupyter Notebooks, braille, …


### Gallery and Catalog

The [Gallery](https://pretextbook.org/gallery.html) is a small collection of mature PreTeXt projects that demonstrate the range of features and the diversity of subjects.

The [Catalog](https://pretextbook.org/catalog.html) is a comprehensive list of PreTeXt projects. You can get a sense of the possibilities, and where authors have public source, you can look to see how certain constructions are authored.

### Starting Out

Reasonably complete documentation is available off the [Documentation](https://pretextbook.org/documentation.html) page. Start with the [PreTeXt Guide](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/), and specifically, the [PreTeXt-CLI](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/quickstart-example.html) is the best tool to begin with.

### Community

Authors, publishers, readers, and developers congregate on Google Groups (in addition to GitHub issues). The support forum is the easiest, quickest, most accurate way to get help from experienced authors, publishers and developers, even if you are just starting out, and have only read the [PreTeXt Guide](https://pretextbook.org/documentation.html) once.

- Support forum/mailing-list: [pretext-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pretext-support)
- Announcements only, low-volume: [pretext-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pretext-announce)
- Feature discussions and implementation: [pretext-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pretext-dev)

Connect with the [#PreTeXtGang](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PreTeXtGang) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PreTeXtBook) or [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@PreTeXt).

The inactive [mathbook-xml-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mathbook-xml-support) group can be searched for old questions and their answers.

### Code

If you would like to contribute to PreTeXt, then [fork](https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext/fork) the [repository](https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext) at GitHub (GPL license). (None of this is necessary when you use the PreTeXt-CLI.)

OR, install git on your system, then at a command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext.git
cd pretext
```

And then it is easy to update, and you should do this regularly (daily):
```
git pull
```

You can download a [zip file](https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for initial experiments, but it will very quickly become out-of-date, so this is not recommended. Take the time to setup and become comfortable with “pulling” as described above.
